# 🚀 HILO Casino Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Verification

### ✅ Build Assets
- [x] Updated build assets with latest changes
- [x] Optimized chunk splitting (Solana wallet, UI components, React vendor)
- [x] Terser minification with console.log removal
- [x] Source maps generated for debugging
- [x] Service worker updated with advanced caching strategies

### ✅ Vercel Configuration
- [x] Modern Vercel configuration (no deprecated `builds` array)
- [x] Framework detection (`vite`)
- [x] Optimized caching headers for different asset types

- [x] Proper MIME types for all file types
- [x] PWA-specific headers for manifest and service worker

### ✅ Performance Optimizations
- [x] Manual chunk splitting for better loading performance
- [x] Long-term caching for static assets (31536000s)
- [x] No caching for HTML files (must-revalidate)
- [x] Optimized service worker with cache-first and network-first strategies
- [x] Console logs removed from production build

### ✅ Security Enhancements
- [x] Content Security Policy headers
- [x] X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- [x] X-Frame-Options: DENY
- [x] X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- [x] Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- [x] Permissions-Policy for restricted features
- [x] Strict-Transport-Security for HTTPS

## Build Output Analysis

### 📊 Current Build Stats

## Deployment Commands

```bash
# Build optimized production bundle
npm run build

# Verify build integrity
node scripts/verify-build.js

# Run deployment optimization check
node scripts/optimize-deployment.js

# Deploy to Vercel (if using Vercel CLI)
vercel --prod
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### 🔍 Functionality Tests

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### 📈 Performance Monitoring
- Set up Vercel Analytics
- Monitor Core Web Vitals
- Track bundle size over time
- Monitor cache hit rates

### 🔄 Update Process
1. Make code changes
2. Run `npm run build`
3. Test locally with `npm run preview`
4. Deploy to staging
5. Run full test suite
6. Deploy to production
7. Verify deployment

### 🚨 Rollback Plan
- Keep previous deployment in Vercel history
- Monitor error rates after deployment
- Have rollback command ready: `vercel rollback`

## Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in Vercel dashboard:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- Any API endpoints or keys needed

## Final Deployment Status

🎉 **Ready for Production Deployment**

All optimizations have been applied:
- ✅ Build assets updated and optimized
- ✅ Vercel configuration modernized
- ✅ Security headers implemented
- ✅ Performance optimizations applied
- ✅ PWA features enhanced
- ✅ Service worker optimized

**Next Step**: Deploy to Vercel and run post-deployment verification tests.
