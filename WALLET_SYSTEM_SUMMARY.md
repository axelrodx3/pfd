# 🔐 HILO Casino - Wallet & User Identity System

## ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

This document summarizes the comprehensive wallet and user identity system that has been implemented for HILO Casino.

## 🎯 **Core Requirements Met**

### 1. **One Connected Wallet = One Permanent Game Wallet**
- ✅ When a user connects their wallet (Phantom, etc.), a new game wallet is automatically generated
- ✅ The game wallet is permanently tied to their connected wallet address
- ✅ On reconnect, the system always returns the same generated wallet for that user
- ✅ No multiple game accounts unless explicitly allowed by user in settings

### 2. **Deposit/Withdraw Flow**
- ✅ **Deposits**: Connected wallet → Game wallet
- ✅ **Withdrawals**: Game wallet → Connected wallet  
- ✅ Game wallet is the only wallet that interacts with gameplay and balance changes
- ✅ Secure transaction simulation with proper validation

### 3. **Admin/Casino Controls**
- ✅ **Freeze Game Wallets**: Admin can freeze any game wallet
- ✅ **Throttle Withdrawals**: Admin can set withdrawal time limits
- ✅ **Balance Checks**: All transactions are validated before approval
- ✅ **Reset Game Wallets**: Admin can reassign/reset compromised wallets

### 4. **Persistence & Security**
- ✅ Secure mapping stored: `connectedWalletAddress → generatedGameWalletAddress`
- ✅ Encrypted storage of private keys (demo-level encryption)
- ✅ Mapping restored on reconnect
- ✅ Support for key rotation and encrypted storage architecture

## 👤 **User Identity & Personalization**

### 1. **Username Creation**
