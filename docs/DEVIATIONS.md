# Territory War Remake â€” Deviation List

- Assets: Using original-inspired stick figures and HILO-themed UI; no original art.
- Input: Mouse hold-to-charge; Space reserved for jump (original used Space to fire in some versions).
- Physics: Arcade approximation for prototype; exact gravity/bounce tuned to feel, not frame-accurate yet.
- Networking: Local prototype only; server-authoritative multiplayer planned in later phase.
- Audio: Simple synthesized SFX placeholders; replaceable with retro samples.
- Maps: Prototype ledges approximate classic island; exact geometry to be matched later.
- UI: HUD styled to resemble original but uses HILO color system.
